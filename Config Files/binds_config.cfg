// Here I need to try something out. The old function did not work where I switched to slot 1 and dropped that to buy primary.
// Because it dropped the secondary if no primary was held.
// Therefor I will need to try out something like this.
// alias "dropprimary" "fdprimary; fdprimary1; fdprimary2; fdprimary3;" 
// alias fdprimary "drop weapon_famas;drop weapon_galil;drop weapon_m4a1;drop weapon_ak47;drop weapon_aug;fdprimary1"

// Now with this, I will make a keybind that drops the pistol without having to change to it, 
// so it will be easy and qiuck to do a fake flash with it.
