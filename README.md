<h1> CSGO Config Files </h1>

<h1> Testing </h1>

**Bold text**

This repository is to share my CSGO config files, (and to save them in the cloud if I need them on another PC at one point).

It contains a lot of different config files, including an autoexec that executed every time the game is loaded, some different crosshairs and viewmodels.

<h3>Custom_config Description</h3>
The autoexec has some of the standard setttings like updaterate on offline server and other stuff. Plus it executes the config with some different binds like buy and jump-throw and a custom config that is quite interesting.

The custom config is somewhat different that a regular config, becuase what this does, is to show some different stuff in the top left corner of the screen. It will always show damage given to other players when you die or when the round is won/lost.

Besides showing Damage Given, it also shows some different settings. 
For example, if you press "F1" in a game, it will mute or unmute all voice communication. And it will display in the top left corner if you muted or unmuted them.
You will still be able to talk to your teammates, but you will not be able to hear them. This is good if you play deathmatch or surf and you don't wanna listen to all the toxic russians that scream into their microphones.

If you press "F2" while in a game, your mouse sensitivity will change to what it is sat to in the config, i have 1.85, 5, 10 and 20. This will show in the top left corner what you sat it too.
This is just for fun, as 20 sensitivity is way to high, but just to act like a spinbotter to your teammates.

The "F3" and "F4" will turn up or down for the game volume. And it will show how high or low it is in the top left corner.

Then the "Delete" key will change your viewmodel, and tell you what model it was changed to. I have my standard viewmodel, and then I have Quake and Gangsta for fun.

And the "End" key will change your crosshair. I have made 4 different crosshairs I like. And it will switch between these in a cycle like the viewmodel.

<h3>Binds_config Description</h3>
The Binds config will make keybinds for mainly buying weapons and gear. But it will also make a couple of other nice binds.
